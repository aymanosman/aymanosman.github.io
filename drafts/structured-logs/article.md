# Structured (JSON) logs in Elixir

[the desire for structured logs -- it is common in some environments to want json formatted logs]

[the approaches one could take in Elixir -- there are a few possible approaches]

[serialize into '$message' -- the non approach]

[reports - the promising but currently unviable approach]

[metadata + custom formatting - the most straightforward approach]

[new backend - should be considered overkill (opinion)]
